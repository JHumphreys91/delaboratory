= Description =

This is an *early prototype* of new delaboratory. 
It *lacks essential features* like curves, vignette or local contrast.
I implemented only *two layers* (think "effects" or "filters") just to show an interface.



= Download =

*unfortunately google code does no longer supports downloads and tells developers to upload files on google drive, which does not work well (strange user interface and no statistics), so if I won't find a better solution I would have to move the project to another website*
