#summary Working with RAW files

= Basic use of delaboratory in combination with Geeqie =

Geegie is nice image viewer for Linux desktops. It is fast and can do really a lot.

The command i use is:

'dcraw -T -W - w -6 %f'

(convert the image selected to a 16 bits tiff file -%f and -T -6, while do not brighten -W and keep camera whitebalance -w) 

I made a shortcut in Geeqie so i don't have to type the command any time i need to convert an image from raw to tiff.
