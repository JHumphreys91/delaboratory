#summary Working with RAW files

= Basic use of delaboratory in combination with Geeqie =

Geegie is nice image viewer for Linux desktops. It is fast and can do really a lot.

The command i use is:

`dcraw -T -W - w -6 %f`

(convert the image selected to a 16 bits tiff file *-%f* and *-T -6*, while do not brighten *-W* and keep camera whitebalance *-w*) 

I made a shortcut in Geeqie so i don't have to type the command any time i need to convert an image from raw to tiff.

I also did make a short cut to delaboratory so i can open images with a right mouse in Geegie.

The added short cuts in Geegie are:
