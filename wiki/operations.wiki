#summary Operations planned for 0.8

typical workflow:
  * open RAW file (so we start in ProPhoto RGB)
  * exposure (brightness, contrast, shadows/highlights, still in ProPhoto)
  * CMYK levels (extend range of CMY colors, preserve details in K channel)
  * BW mixer (RGB or ProPhoto to BW)
  * vignette od dodge/burn, to increase image depth (both in LAB or BW)
  * local contrast (USM with big radius in LAB or BW)

other steps:
  * white balance, click on neutral point (AB shift in LAB)
  * apply green channel in luminance mode for portraits (RGB or ProPhoto)
  * CMYK sharpen K for portraits
  * USM sharpen in LAB/BW
  * saturation slider in LAB
  * saturation curve in LCH (chroma)
  * luminance curve (L in LAB)
  * hue shift (in LCH or HSV or HSL)
  * HSV/HSL/LCH equalizer (by hue)
  * LAB equalizer (by L)
  * high pass sharpening (must be simpler to use)
  * blur AB channels in LAB to decrease color noise
  * vignette in RGB is sometimes better than in LAB
  * CMYK curves
  * RGB curves
  * AB curves (LAB)
  * RGB levels
  * AB levels (LAB)
  * RGB mixer
