#summary Operations planned for 0.8

Casual users don't understand what's the reason to use multiple colorspaces. While they use it in any other program (for instance to change saturation or set white balance), they are not power users and they don't want to think about it. So the idea for 0.8 is to hide colorspaces from them.

There will be three groups of buttons in new interface:
  * basic - typical operations for casual user (exposure, white balance, levels, vignette, local contrast, equalizer)
  * advanced - more creative operations (luminance curve, saturation curve, RGB mixer, hue shift, bigger equalizer)
  * expert - the old set of operations (conversions, curves, mixer, apply image, etc)

Examples of operations in groups basic and advanced:

typical workflow:
  * open RAW file (so we start in !ProPhoto RGB)
  * exposure (brightness, contrast, shadows/highlights, still in !ProPhoto)
  * CMYK levels (extend range of CMY colors, preserve details in K channel)
  * BW mixer (RGB or !ProPhoto to BW)
  * vignette od dodge/burn, to increase image depth (both in LAB or BW)
  * local contrast (USM with big radius in LAB or BW)

other steps:
  * white balance, click on neutral point (AB shift in LAB)
  * apply green channel in luminance mode for portraits (RGB or !ProPhoto)
  * CMYK sharpen K for portraits
  * USM sharpen in LAB/BW
  * saturation slider in LAB
  * saturation curve in LCH (chroma)
  * luminance curve (L in LAB)
  * hue shift (in LCH or HSV or HSL)
  * HSV/HSL/LCH equalizer (by hue)
  * LAB equalizer (by L)
  * high pass sharpening (must be simpler to use)
  * blur AB channels in LAB to decrease color noise
  * vignette in RGB is sometimes better than in LAB
  * CMYK curves
  * RGB curves
  * AB curves (LAB)
  * RGB levels
  * AB levels (LAB)
  * RGB mixer
