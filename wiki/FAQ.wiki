#summary FAQ

*Q* Are you going to implement RAW support in delaboratory?

*A* It is possible to add RAW support by calling _dcraw_ or using _libraw_, however, I don't really see good reason for that. There are mature raw processors (I use and recommend _rawtherapee_), I can't make anything better, I can only make whole workflow simpler (faster?). This is definitely not the top priority.

*Q* Are you going to implement painting, dodge/burn, clone tool, healing brush, etc?

*A* Currently delaboratory always works on previews - scaled down images. Each local modification requires access to full size image. So the first step in way to this direction is to implement zoom support. This is complex task and won't happen in the near future - color correction is more important. Currently I use local sharpening and clone/heal in _GIMP_.

*Q* Are color profiles supported?

*A* No. In my workflow I use 16-bit tiffs generated by _rawtherapee_, they have no ICC profile included, they are just sRGB and everything works as expected. I am aware of problem with ICC profiles in tiffs generated by dcraw or commercial raw processors. These profiles are ignored (but there is a message box to inform you about it). Please understand that delaboratory is my hobby project - to implement color profile management I must have good reason, and currently I don't see any. 

*Q* Can you add one more colorspace?

*A* Tell me which one do you want and why do you want and where can I read about it. You can even add it yourself, this piece of code is quite easy (you just need to know equations for RGB conversion).

*Q* Will you add more effects?

*A* Yes, that's the plan. Currently I think about equalizer (similar to HSV equalizer from _rawtherapee_) and wavelet sharpen (see _GIMP_ plugin).

*Q* Will there be plugins?

*A* Yes. I want to use _GREYC's Magic Image Converter_ http://gmic.sourceforge.net/ for that, it's already used as plugin in _GIMP_ (but limited to 8-bit per channel, in delaboratory it will of course use 32-bit per channel).

*Q* Why 32-bit per channel? Isn't 16-bit enough for 16-bit images?

*A* The output color depth doesn't really matter. If you only watch photos on monitor all you need on output is 8-bit per channel. What really matters is color depth inside the engine. 32-bit per channel means I don't have to worry about conversions and round errors. Of course there is a cost - twice larger memory usage.

*Q* What's the delaboratory direct competitor?

*A* I am not aware of any application with similar design, philosophy and features. Please don't compare delaboratory with raw processors, _GIMP_ or _PHOTOSHOP_ - it's totally different approach. The main reason why there are no other applications with this set of features is that Free Software developers don't need them. 

*Q* Why are you creating this?

*A* I love Free Software, I use it on my desktop since 1998. I bought my first digital camera in 2005, in 2009 photography started to be my really serious hobby. I quickly realized what are limits of _GIMP_, I was searching for alternatives - I discovered _rawtherapee_ and _GMIC_. I was under heavy influence of Dan Margulis classic guide to color correction. The delaboratory is a product of all my experiences. I code this project because I need it for my photos. It does what I need in my postprocessing. It fits exactly between rawtherapee and Gimp in my workflow. 

*Q* Can I help?

*A* Yes! You can create package for your operating system or distribution (see [Installation] for existing packages). You can find bugs and report them here: http://code.google.com/p/delaboratory/issues/list. If you are a programmer - you can help with implementation of new effects (all you need is to know algorithm you want to add).
