#summary Design philosophy

   * *KISS* - keep it simple
   * *Free Software* - delabotory is licensed under GPL3
   * *each colorspace should be treated equally*, each operation should be available in each colorspace
   * *fully non-destructive processing*, each operation can be adjusted at any time
   * *floating point precision* in the whole engine, no problems with conversions to 8 or 16 bits
   * *realtime preview* everything should be visible immediately
