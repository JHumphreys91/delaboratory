#summary ColorSpaces

each action layer in delaboratory is available in each colorspace, and in each case it will work differently, if you want to explore delaboratory it's a good idea to try each colorspace and see how they can be used

delaboratory supports 9 color spaces:

  * sRGB http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB
  * ProPhoto http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPhoto
  * BW http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale
  * LAB http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space
  * LCH http://www.colourphil.co.uk/lab_lch_colour_space.html
  * CMYK http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmyk
  * CMY 
  * HSV http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV
  * HSL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV

sRGB is the most popular color space, every color is a mix of Red, Green and Blue

!ProPhoto is similar to sRGB but has wider gamut, it means that some colors outside sRGB colorspace can be presented in !ProPhoto, this is important when you open RAW file and it's colors are clipped in sRGB but are not in !ProPhoto - during the edit you can save the details in highlights or shadows

BW is just single channel grayscale representation of image, it's very important to control the process of color -> BW conversion and understand how BW image can be used to improve the final color image, there are multiple books on this subject

LAB is famous colorspace which separates luminance from color, many applications fully work in LAB colorspace inside, because it's so good in post processing

LCH is similar to LAB, but instead "not so user friendly" A/B channels there is a chroma (saturation) and hue, so if you want to play with saturation without changing balance of colors - it's better than LAB

CMYK is the only colorspace which has 4 channels, that's why it's special and that's why it's so powerful, most people don't understand why this colorspace can be used in post processing and they just associate CMYK with printing, that's why it's not available in many Free Software projects at all

CMY is just reversed RGB, it's like CMYK but without K

HSV/HCL are old colorspaces which separate luminance from color, but they don't make it so well as LAB/LCH, but they are quite famous so they are available
