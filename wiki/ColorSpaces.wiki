#summary ColorSpaces

= RGB =

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rgb

RGB color space is the one which is most popular. Every application supports it, because computers and digital cameras work in RGB. 

This is *worst colorspace for correcting color with curves*. It's good for special effects (like cross processing http://www.gimpforphotos.com/tutorial-intermediate/cross-processing.html) but it's very difficult to fix some color problems with RGB curves.

= BW = 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale

BW colorspace has only one channel: grayscale. 

There are long (really long) articles, tutorials even books about converting photo to Black and White, there are many methods for that. Even if you are going to produce color photo you still should know how to use BW image to blend it or to create masks.

= CMYK = 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmyk

CMYK is different than other color spaces because it has 4 channels. CMY colorspace is just reversed RGB, but CMYK adds new channel: *key*. Working with 4 channels instead 3 gives more possibilities in retouching.

The most common reason for using CMYK colorspace is to prepare images for printing. But the true reason why CMYK is interesting for photos is that it's *very good colorspace for correcting skin tones*. So if you have photos with people on them - it's worth trying.

= LAB = 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space

LAB colorspace separates color from contrast. Channel *L* is for *lightness*, channel *A* is for *green-magenta* colors and channel *B* is for *blue-yellow* colors. 

This is *best colorspace for correcting color casts*. It's also very good in creating *masks*, for instance if you want to separate some objects. It's very easy to *boost colors* by increasing contrast of A and B channels, so one can put life into dull photos.

= HSV/HSL = 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV

HSV and HSL colorspaces have *hue* and *saturation* values in their channels. 

Wikipedia has nice comparision of the third channel.
