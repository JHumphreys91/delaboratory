#summary LAB Curves info / tutorial

= Introduction LAB Curves =

I was asked to write a Lab curves tutorial. Due to some personal happenings i have to ask you all to be a bit patient. I will update this page often so it will some time a work in progress.

First my apologies for my bad English. If anybody wants to fix grammar / typo's  please send me a mail.

I am no expert just a user. If you have comments and or remarks / suggestions? Please send me mail so i can add / correct my text. Questions? Please ask i will do my best to answer! 

I will address the next topics:

* My basic use of delaboratory in combination with Geeqie

* Basic introduction to Lab colorspace

* Introduction to curves.
(first i will adress the L channel)

- Some curves and basic functions aka how to use them
- How to set White Point Black point
- Relight underexposed and overexposed images
- Enhance contrast
- Work with color values and markers. Aka how to work presice.
- Use of Jacobs Ladder in L channel

* Basic introduction to the a and b channel

- Change adapt White Balance
- Enhance saturation
- Some toning
- Introduction to Man from Mars. Popping up colors and blending them into the image.
- Introduction to Jacobs Ladder in a and b channel An another methode of popping up colors

When working on this tuto i will use dcraw started in Geeqie to open convert the raw files. [workingwithRAWfiles]

= Basic introduction to Lab colorspace =

First off, one needs to understand the three channels and forget all you know about RGB. RGB is made for machines like displays. Lab is modeled after how our brains do 'process' light. When you are used to RGB, you will have to get adjusted to Lab. As all humans hate change, (monkey's as we are), it will cost some effort. Though when you did you have some powerful tools extra available for every day processing.

First the L channel. This is the Luminance channel. 

Second the color spectrum is devided in only 2 channels, Not three. Af first you will find it strange to work with, though very soon you will see how intuitive, precise it is. It matches very well how we FEEL colors. We feel colors as hot and cold. That is exactly the power of the a and b channel. We do not see colors as a mix of r g b. That is how machines work not we. More about that later on.

Lab is no holy grail, It is just a great flexible and precise interface. It can't be missed for advanced Post Processing. If you really want to control your image you can not do without Lab.

= The Light channel. =

L = Luminance 
Light an dark only!

So we use the L channel curve to lighten / darken areas of the image and we use it for contrast

Important to understand / know is bottom left is the most dark in your image aka your Black Point. Top right is the most white in your image aka your White Point. The range is 0-100 with zero being black. 100 being white, and 50 being about middle gray.

Roughly it can be said the lower third of the curve controls the shadows. aka the darker part, the mid third the mid-tones, and the upper third the highlights. It is not that strict though just to give a handon to start with.

As shown in this image:

Note: When one does add only one point the place where one did put it will be most effected, though as the whole curve will change the whole image will be effected. If one whants only a very specific area to be altered one needs to add more points.

= Basics L channel curve.=

* Recovering an underexposed image.

For now we forget RGB. later of course we will use again the great powers of RGB though first we neglect it.

First we are going to play a bit with lighten up an image which is underexposed. 

http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/2824/darkimage.jpg

Please download the image above. Start delab. Open the image.
Press add layer. chose convert. Select Lab. Press add layer chose curves

Double click curves a pop up with the Lab curves window will show. Right on top you see the options to select a histogram. Please select L so we can see the L channel histogram.

If you did use the dcraw command with the switches i did suggest he image will look dark and perhaps a bit dull. Though that will be fixed in no time and as YOU want it.

The first step is we are gonna relight the image and aka brighten / darken. 

CLick on the image somewhere in the dark. Move the spot a bit and a cross hair will show up in the L curves window.  Set the sampler to LAB so we can see the values of the spots we add.

abit like this: 

http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/5236/darkstep1.png

A point is in effect a two dimensional slider. Move the point a litle bit to the left  and move  it a little bit up. And see what happens.

Here you see a screen shot where i did relight the image a bit. I did also add a second point at the green leaves in the background. As it became to bright. After i knew the point on the curve i could darken only the leaves. leaving the rest the same. It is not perfect yet. Though we did do a big step forward just adding a few points where needed and adjust accordingly the L channel curve.

Final image. As you can see the dark parts are fixed while leaving the highlights close to untouched. I am not aware of any other way then curves to relight this presice. 

Here i did use also the A and B channel Did sharpen a bit and did blend a bit. I will adress those later on.

All relightning is done with L-channel curves. The RGB tab is not used!

Later on you will see how great this is as you have a very accurate contrast and brighten / darken control where you want it!.

Summary basic L channel relighting.

Convert to LAB. Add curves layer. Left bottom are the dark area's Top right the highlights. Put some points in the image where you need to lighten / darken. Move the points a little bit, so a cross hair will show in the L curves window. If you need to remove a point just drag it outside the window and it will vanish.

= Some more basics =

* White and Black point.

Set the white and black point.  The White Point (WP) is the Luminance value that is pure white in the image. As the Black Point (BP) is the Luminance value that is pure black in the image. This can be set very easily. WP: click on the image what should be pure white. Move it a ll bit so the cross hair shows move that point straight up and a new white point is set. Reverse operation for setting the BP.

See this image
http://img828.imageshack.us/img828/6425/wp1wg.jpg

The points set are not white nor black as the value is not 0 (Black) or 100 (White) in the L channel. The negative value in the b channel tell us we have a (very slight) blue cast. Aka the White Balance is not 100% correct. More about that later on.

http://img845.imageshack.us/img845/9293/wp2q.jpg

Here the WP and BP is set at the points and the values are now pure white and pure black. As the curve got steeper there is also more contrast in the parts between the new WP and BP. At the moment Delab only has spline curves. Here we would want a linear Though Jacek told me other curves types like linear will be added. 

* Contrast and S-curves.

The S curve you saw in the last image wil be used a lot in all channels.

Very important to know and understand is: The steeper the curve is in the L-channel the more the contrast the more flat a curve is the less the contrast. A steeper curve in a and b channel will increase saturaton. Note: this can be done VERY locally. Also remind all curves types we will address can be merged used to gether, aka use in conjunction. Up to you ! More about a and b channel later on.

Now the smart dude in the class yells: "So wtf on every part i do enhance contrast i will loose some on other parts when i use a S curve."

Yes smart dude that is very, very correct. The art is to enhance contrast where you need it and loose it where it has no effects. Or even less contrast on those area's might enhance the image. No need to have contrast in very dark or very light parts. You want contrast in those parts your images tells something. There you want the attention of user .There you want to lead his / her eye.

S-curves will add contrast in the mid-tones. and give away some in the shadows and highlights. . Remind it is very powerful. So SMALL changes when you start.

An another smart dude raises his finger.

"Aha now it start to get it. That is why i need to know where each part of the curve does apply, and why i need a cross-hair even in L- channel and that the histogram is here again of great help. 

Yes smart-dude nr 2 you are very very correct!

With delab one can choose a point and steepen the curve there so the that tone area will have more contrast or less just as you want it.


= Some more curve types =


When you did play a bit with the curves you most likely did use also more or less of the curve types i will adress now.

http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/5760/contrastcurve.png
* The Boost * consists of a is a common contrast enhancing move that consists of moving both endpoints toward the middle. It is most often the result of setting the shadow or highlight by changing the White and or Black point when done in L channel. As it steepens the curve it does also increase contrast. In a and b channel it does boost saturation.

http://www.curvemeister.com/support/curvemeister2/help/Articles/CurveMoves/S.gif
* The S curve * increases contrast in the midtones, and reduces contrast in the shadow and highlight. It resembles the response curve of film in that light and dark detail is compressed, The main difference whith the boost curve in L channel is that it does not alter the White and or Black point. It only boosts contrast. Very powerfull. 

http://www.curvemeister.com/support/curvemeister2/help/Articles/CurveMoves/Lift.gif
* The Raise * bumps up the mid tones and leaves the end points alone. Like the Drop, it may be used for either overall brightness increase (when used on all channels affecting brightness, or with the master curve), or color balance.

http://www.curvemeister.com/support/curvemeister2/help/Articles/CurveMoves/Drop.gif
* The Drop * simply "drops" the midtone slightly without changing the endpoints. It changes overall darkness when applied to all channels, or color balance and overall brightness in the midtones when applied to fewer channels.

* High Shoulder http://www.curvemeister.com/support/curvemeister2/help/Articles/CurveMoves/HighShoulder.gif* is half of an S curve. It is used to increase shadow detail while compressing highlights without losing them completely.

http://www.curvemeister.com/support/curvemeister2/help/Articles/CurveMoves/LizardTail.gif
* Lizard tail * is a very small and sharp upturn or downturn at the end of a curve, normally used to rescue or otherwise emphasize shadow or highlight detail that is in danger of being lost.

This goes very well with the high shoulder and the Raise curve as shown in my very underexposed image though one might need to flatten the highshoulder or the lizard tail when both types are combined.


This is a lot of info. Though with this knowedge one can start to explore the use of the L-channel.

These images are just provided for educational use. As in practice the different types will be combined,  When you get the hang of it. you will be able to combine the different types and adjust your image very precise to your needs. We also blend. As Lab needs blending.

= Some about the A and B channel =

The a and b channel control the color spectrum i a way that is a lot like our brain and color film. The color spectrum is devide in magenta, green, blue an yellow. The b channel controls blue and yellow

A Chnnel

B channel

Important to know is that in A and B channel negative values are cold and positive vallues are warm

When fixing WB we use this princple:

= A practice =

* Removing a local blue cast / correct local White Balance and add some local contrast *



Because we did have a lot of theory it is time to work on some pics. And learn that way.

I did find a very interesting image taken by Guillermo Luijk.

http://www.guillermoluijk.com/article/wb/wbinout1.jpg

Please download the image by right click save as)

This image is interesting because of several things.

1 The white-balance out doors is different from the white-balance in the church. This does give the outside walls a blue cast. 

The camera or the photographer did choose an inside WB aka the light of the lamps we see above the window. So of course the day sunlight gets screwed up. We will give each its correct lighting and play a bit with it.

2. This image is also very interesting because of the artificial lightning in the church.

3. The image has very few colors.


* 1. Lets start with the White-balance / fix the blue cast.*

As you will see this in Lab color space and delab very easy

Please open the image, convert to LAB and add curves layer.
Open the B channel, as there the WB can be set and the blue cast can be removed.

Put some points on the blue cast on the wall outside.
The negative b values represent the blue cast. Move the one whith the most negavite number a bit. So we get the cross hair

http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/4272/church1.jpg

Now how to put a point in the center of the curve and move it * horizontally * towards the vertical line of the cross hair. You will see the blue cast has gone. Perhaps you want to correct the yellows a bit also. Put a point in the center between the point you just did move and the top move it slightly down so the line above the 'blue point' is flat or close to flat. Play a bit with the 'yellow' point untile the yellow in the church is basically ok. 

http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2613/bluecastfix.png

Look at the blue 'move' I did move the point in the center to the left so it would touch the cross-hair. This did fix the blue cast. As a result of this move the color temp inside the church got to warm. Whith two other dots i did fix that by moving them down so there it colder. The get the point where to move first i did sat a marker in the roof of the church.

Lets compare the images:

Original


http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1540/bluecastfixed.jpg

Blue cast fixed

Resume: 

We did fix the blue cast by setting a point and correcting the negative blue value to 0 by sliding the center of the b channel to the left until it did reach the vertical line of the cross hair and voila the blue cast was fixed. We also did correct the temperature of the tones inside the church as they got to warm.

By adding a new curve we can and will set the warmth inside the church even more. Also we will add contrast inside the church where we need it to make the image much more vivid.

Lessons learned: 

Correcting cast by using value's. Slide until the value has the value one does need.

Setting new White Ballance outside by moving the center to the left to a set point. 
Moving the center to the left makes a image warmer. Moving it to the right makes images colder. The White Balllance can be set very locally. Whith linear curves even more local then whith spline curves.

* 2 Enhance contrast in the church.

As you can see on the previous image i did already add three points where i do want more contrast. The idea is to pop up very local the contrast. To do that real neat we need not a spline though a linear curve. Though whith splines it also can be done. It will be just a bit less dramatic. To pop up local colors or contrast we can use a technique called Jacob's Ladder and or a technique called Man from Mars. The boost will also be used. In fact we will use all of them. By blending we will control them.


Process to final image will i publicize tomorrow
