= basic use of delaboratory in combination with Geeqie =

I am a Linux user, sry Windows people. So some will be Linux specific. I am sure there are for Windows equal solutions. Though i do not know them as i do not use it.


Geegie is imho the image viewer for Linux desktops. It is fast can do really a lot.

When working on this tuto i will use dcraw started in Geeqie to open convert the raw files. 

The command i use is dcraw -t -W - w -6 %f (=convert the image selected to a 16 bits tiff file -%f and -t -6, while do not brighten -W and keep camera whitebalance -w) I made a shortcut in Geeqie so i don't have to type the command any time i need to convert an image from raw to tiff.
