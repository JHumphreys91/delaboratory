#summary delaboratory features

delaboratory is *NOT a RAW processor* and is *NOT a per-pixel editor*, this is a *color correction utility*

delaboratory features:

  * floating point precision - it means that internal code uses not 8-bit (like Gimp), not 16-bit (like many apps), but *float for each color component*, input and output will use 16-bit tiffs or 8-bit jpgs

  * native support for *RGB*/*BW*, *CMY*/*CMYK*, *XYZ*/*LAB*, *HSV*/*HSL* colorspaces - each colorspace is equal, can be displayed, can be edited same way, the only limitation is the conversion between two colorspaces, sometimes it will require two steps (CMYK to RGB then RGB to HSV, instead CMYK to HSV), because it's boring to create lots of similar conversion functions :)

  * *adjustment layers* - it's not possible to "flatten" like in Gimp, so each operation is available for edit, the more layers you create the more complex the project will be, it's possible to change the "source" layer of each layer and colorspace, configuration windows of each frame can stay on screen, so it's possible to modify - for instance - mixer and curves at same time, supported layer types: conversion, mixer, curves, blend

  * *realtime* - premature optimization is root of all evil so I am not going to do strange stuff while the project is far from complete, but it should be possible to use delaboratory on modern desktop computer in realtime, without waiting for anything, when you move slider you should see how preview changes, there is a danger that usage of many layers will eat memory, but that's OK, the real problem is not to slow-down operations and calculate only these previews which are really needed at given time

  * *curves* - each channel in each colorspace can be processed by curve, marker show position on curve (taken from currently touched sapler), *current implementation of curves is VERY SIMPLIFIED* (no spline/bezier, just straight lines), 

  * *mixer* - from each colorspace to each colorspace, for instance one can mix RGB colorspace to achieve BW (black and white) image, but it's also possible to mix from RGB to LAB or CMYK if you want (there are no limitations at all), natural usage is of course mix RGB to RGB or LAB to LAB

  * *blend* - it's possible to blend all channels (it's not yet clear what to do when number of channel differs) or single channel, or blend single channel to all channels, supported blend modes: *normal*, *multiply*, *screen*, *overlay*

  * *lockable samplers* - it's possible to lock multiple samplers on given places and watch color values (any colorspace) in this place during the edit

plans for near future:
   * blur (per channel)
   * rendering of simple shapes for ND-filter-like stuff (vignette, etc)
   * not sure what to do with sharpening, it should be last step of processing, but delaboratory should be just part of workflow so sharpening is probably pointless
   * load multiple images to use as masks (blending)

delaboratory won't support in near future:

   * drawing, brushes, per-pixel operations (clone/healing)
   * RAW file processing
   * crop, resize, rotate
