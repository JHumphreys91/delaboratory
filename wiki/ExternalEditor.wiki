On Windows, the default graphics editor is gimp-2.8.exe. If you
install Gimp from (www.partha.com), Delaboratory will automatically
use this version when exporting to external editor for final pixel
level editing.

However, now one has the option to use their own favorite editor such
as Photo.Net etc. One does this by setting an environment variable
pointing to their editor. To do this set an environment variable
called GR_EDITOR to the full path of the executable of the editor.  To
set an environment variable in Windows, follow the instructions at
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519 for Windows XP. On Windows 7
Check for example http://www.itechtalk.com/thread3595.html.

On the Mac, if you have the Gimp App provided by Partha, you will need
to make sure that this App resides in the Application folder just like
all other Mac application. In this scenario, when you click on "Send
to External Editor", your image will open in Gimp.
