#summary Known issues

BUGS:
  * after change colorspace of source of curves - the curves layer still thinks the old colorspace is used

TODO:
  * zooming is not implemented yet (but you can change size of window!)
  * curves are *very simplified*, instead beautiful bezier or splines you will see straight lines between points
  * *no blend masking* yet  
  * no color profiles, there is just "RGB" 
  * no GCR settings for CMYK conversion (not sure if there is any point for them)
  * only 4 blend modes are implemented, it's easy to add more
  * no direct conversions between some colorspacies, so - for instance - you can't sample CMYK values when using HSV layer 
  * rendering of LAB mode is slower than other modes, because it uses pow() for calculations, RGB mode works fastests because there is no conversion
  * number of samplers is fixed to 4, this is not limitation of engine but problem with GUI - I need to find good way to display many samplers and make it readable
  * displayed values in sampler are not scaled, they are always between 0.0 and 1.0, the goal is to scale them so A and B in LAB will be also negative, etc...
  * no different colors (on histogram/curves graphs) for channels other than RGB, I need to decide what colors should be used for colorspaces like XYZ or HSL :)
  * input/output support in early stages, it's possible to load 8-bit and 16-bit TIFF and 8-bit JPEG, it's possible to save 16-bit TIFF or 8-bit JPEG
  * GUI can be improved in many ways
  * saving project (layer stack) is not implemented (of course it is possible to save the image! you just can't save "configuration")
