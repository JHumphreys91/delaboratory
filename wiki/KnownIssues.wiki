#summary Known issues

BUGS:
  * after change colorspace of source of curves - the curves layer still thinks the old colorspace is used

TODO:
  * curves are *very simplified*, instead beautiful bezier or splines you will see straight lines between points
  * *no blend masking* yet
  * only 4 blend modes are implemented, it's easy to add more
  * no direct conversions between some colorspacies, so - for instance - you can't sample CMYK values when using HSV layer 
  * displayed values in sampler are not scaled, they are always between 0.0 and 1.0, the goal is to scale them so A and B in LAB will be also negative, etc...
  * no different colors (on histogram/curves graphs) for channels other than RGB, I need to decide what colors should be used for colorspaces like XYZ or HSL :)
  * input/output support in early stages, it's possible to load 16-bit tiff or 8-bit jpeg, and I am not even sure will every tiff work (I tested it on tiff produced by RT), I will need to improve it
  * GUI can be improved in many ways
