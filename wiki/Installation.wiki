#summary Installation

= Introduction =

project has just started and is not ready for end users, there are no binary packages, you have to compile it yourself

= Requirements =

You need wxWidgets. 
I use version 2.8.12.
To check your version please type:

`wx-config --version`

If there is no wx-config then you need to install wxWidgets first or delaboratory won't compile. 

In Arch Linux there is just wxGTK package, but I know that for instance in Ubuntu there is wxBase and wxGTK - you need *wxGTK*.

You will also need a *C++ compiler* (g++ or just gcc) and *libtiff*. Should be already instaled on your distro.

= Compilation =

Please extract sources and type:

`make`

if you want to install it, su root and:

`make install`

= Windows = 

As far as I know there are no problems with compiling delaboratory on Linux (don't know if anyone tried on BSD).

I am aware of two people who were trying to compile delaboratory on Windows, but they both compiled the code but had problems with their wxWidgets installation. So if you are able to compile anything using wxWidgets on Windows - please try to compile delaboratory and let me know, your experiences may be useful for others :)
