= Compiling the source code =

You need wxWidgets. 
I use version 2.8.12.
To check your version please type:

`wx-config --version`

If there is no wx-config then you need to install wxWidgets first or delaboratory won't compile. 

In Arch Linux there is just wxGTK package, but I know that for instance in Ubuntu there is wxBase and wxGTK - you need *wxGTK*.

You will also need a *C++ compiler* (g++ or just gcc), *libxml2*, and *libtiff*. Should be already instaled on your distro.

Please extract sources and type:

`make`

if you want to install it, su root and:

`make install`
