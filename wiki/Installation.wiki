== on terminal ==

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dhor/myway`

`sudo apt-get install delaboratory`

=Debian and Debian based distro's like , Dreamlinux. Mint LMDE=

Add to sources.list

'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/dhor/myway/ubuntu lucid main' 

'deb-src http://hppa.launchpad.net/dhor/myway/ubuntu lucid main'

sudo or su 

'apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93330B78'

'apt-get update'

'apt-get install delaboratory'

= Arch Linux =

AUR package was crated by speps, you can find it here:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=49517

= Compiling the source code =

You need wxWidgets. 
I use version 2.8.12.
To check your version please type:

`wx-config --version`

If there is no wx-config then you need to install wxWidgets first or delaboratory won't compile. 

In Arch Linux there is just wxGTK package, but I know that for instance in Ubuntu there is wxBase and wxGTK - you need *wxGTK*.

You will also need a *C++ compiler* (g++ or just gcc), *libxml2*, and *libtiff*. Should be already instaled on your distro.

Please extract sources and type:

`make`

if you want to install it, su root and:

`make install`
