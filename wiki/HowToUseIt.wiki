#summary How to use it

= simple RGB operations =

Let's say that you have RAW from RawTherapee or Ufraw and you want to perform some simple operations on your photo: curves and mixer. You can do it in GIMP, but it will be limited to 8-bit color, so you will decrease quality of your photo. It's better to do it in delaboratory then send image to GIMP for further postprocessing.

  * *open* your image in delaboratory (File, Open)
  * add *curves layer*
  * double click on curves layer and *set curves*
  * add *mixer layer*
  * double click on mixer layer and *set mixer*
  * if you want you can edit curves or mixer again and again
  * *send* image to GIMP
