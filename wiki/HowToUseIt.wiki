#summary How to use it

= intro =

delaboratory should be used in the middle of the workflow - after RAW processing, before final retouch, I use it between RawTherapee and GIMP

= external materials = 

*[Books]* - books with techniques to use in delaboratory

*VideoTutorials* - tutorials (performed in photoshop) with techniques to use in delaboratory 

*TextTutorials* - tutorials to read

= blur hints (new in 0.2) = 

  * blur is *not for skin smoothing* - you can't draw on mask so it won't work this way (however you could achieve something like that if you blend *key* channel from original CMYK on blured layer)
  * Use it with *blend* layer for best effect (set blured layer as overlay and original as source)
  * experiment with different channels in different colorspaces (in *LAB* blur only A and B channels)
  * if you select big radius it will be slow, it may be a good idea to type the radius in the text field instead using slider
  * blur can be really slow, if you set it to 0.1 it means 10% width of image per pixel, it means that for image of width 4000 pixels there will be 1 600 000 calculations per single line of image, so you will need to wait minutes for calculations of final image, solution: use smaller values 

= ND hints (new in 0.2) =

  * try it in LAB on A and B channels, you will be really surprised
  * you can use multiple ND layers to create more complex shapes
  * negative power works, just only in some special cases

= simple RGB operations =

Let's say that you have RAW from RawTherapee or Ufraw and you want to perform some simple operations on your photo: curves and mixer. You can do it in GIMP, but it will be limited to 8-bit color, so you will decrease quality of your photo. It's better to do it in delaboratory then send image to GIMP for further postprocessing.

  * *open* your image in delaboratory (File, Open)
  * add *curves layer*
  * double click on curves layer and *set curves*
  * add *mixer layer*
  * double click on mixer layer and *set mixer*
  * if you want you can edit curves or mixer again and again
  * *send* image to GIMP

= convert image to Black and White =

There are many ways to convert your photo to BW, the most common way is to use mixer. 

  * *open* your image in delaboratory (File, Open)
  * add *mixer layer*
  * double click on mixer layer and *change colorspace to BW*
  * click *apply*
  * double click on mixer layer and *set mixer*
  * *send* image to GIMP

Of course more advanced methods will also work. You could:

  * blend RGB channels in overlay mode by using *blend layers*
  * convert image to LAB or CMYK and use L or K channels

= correct skin color =

This is the most common problem with portrait postprocessing. How to achieve good skin tone?

  * *open* your image in delaboratory (File, Open)
  * add *conversion layer*
  * double click on conversion layer and *change colorspace to CMYK*
  * click on image and add some *samplers* on skin
  * change colorspace of samplers to *CMYK*
  * add *curves layer*
  * double click on curves layer and *set curves*
  * *send* image to GIMP 
(you don't have to convert to RGB, it will be performed automagicaly)

When playing with CMYK curves - try to set *yellow* a little larger than *magenta* and much larger than *cyan* (please google for skin color by numbers for details).

= change colors in LAB =

LAB separates color from contrast, so you can play with colors without danger of destroying contrast of your photo.

  * *open* your image in delaboratory (File, Open)
  * add *conversion layer*
  * double click on conversion layer and *change colorspace to LAB*
  * add *blend layer*
  * double click on blend layer and *set blend options*
  * change blending mode to *overlay* and set *alpha*
  * add *curves layer*
  * double click on curves layer and *set curves*
  * add *mixer layer*
  * double click on mixer layer and *set mixer*
  * *send* image to GIMP 

Try different channels in blend layer, try mixing A and B channels. You can change settings all over again and when finish when you will be happy with the result.
