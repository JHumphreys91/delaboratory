#summary How to use it

= introduction for first time users =

  * every operation in delaboratory is stored as layer, to add new operation you have to add new layer with *add layer button*

  * after you add layer you need to configure it (for instance when you add curves layer it contains "neutral" curve which does nothing), you need to *double click layer* and then set it (for instance set curve to the shape you want), there is no "OK" button because each change happens immediately, you can safely close layer window when you done, or you can use it later 

  * every layer has its *source*, by default this is previous layer, so each layer is based on last one, but you can change it, every layer can use every other bottom layer as its source

  * every layer has its *colorspace*, by default it's RGB but the primary feature of delaboratory is ability to work in multiple colorspaces, explore this feature (hint: start with LAB colorspace which is widely know and very usable), to convert image between one colorspace and another please use *conversion layer*

  * during the edit, delaboratory works on *previews*, not full image, there are two reasons for that: speed and memory consumption, after you done, you need to *generate final image* with one of the save buttons at the bottom of main window, it will take some time, it can use huge amount of your memory, so when you are not sure - you can also *save project* first to avoid any problems

  * to learn more about this technique of image processing I recommend looking at work of *Dan Margulis*, but also search for info about *"LAB colorspace"*, *"digital BW photography"*, *"image channels"* and *"blend modes"*

= apply luminance = 

  * open source image
  * add "curves" layer (in RGB)
  * play with curves to achieve best contrast, don't worry about colors
  * add "apply luminance" layer
  * in "apply luminance" set source layer to the source image and overlay layer to curves
  
The result is photo with same colors as original, but much better contrast.
*tip* you can still modify curves layer to see how it affects luminance!

= apply color = 

  * open source image (or just continue processing from last section)
  * add "curves" layer (in RGB)
  * play with curves to achieve best color, don't worry about contrast
  * add "apply color" layer
  * in "apply color" set source layer to the one from first step and overlay layer to curves
  
The result is photo with colors you set by curves, but preserving original contrast.
*tip* you can still modify curves layer to see how it affects color!

= convert image to Black and White = 

There are many ways to achieve that, there are complete books about this subject. So let's just look at two simple ways.

  * add "mixer" layer
  * change mixer colorspace to BW
  * play with sliders

Using mixer is the most common way of doing that, but after my experiences with portraits I found one more interesting solution. It's based on green channel (assuming your source is RGB) and overlays red and blue channels on it.

  * add "rgb2bw" layer
  * play with sliders

*tip* you can use BW version of your photo for apply luminance layer!

= LAB curves =

LAB is very powerful colorspace and very easy to use if you learn it.

  * add "conversion" layer
  * set conversion colorspace to LAB
  * add "curves" layer
  * play with L curve to modify contrast
  * play with A and B curves to modify colors

*tip* if you want to continue processing in RGB just add another conversion layer and set its colorspace to RGB

= color by numbers =

This technique is very useful with skintones, you just need to learn some rules (like "yellow" should be bigger than "magenta" and much larger than "cyan") and you can set correct skin color very easily.

  * click on image to add "samplers" in different areas of skin
  * set samplers colorspace to CMYK
  * add "curves" layer (in RGB)
  * play with curves to get correct numbers in each sampler

*tip* you are playing with colors only, so it may be good idea to use "apply color" layer after that to preserve contrast

= shadows and highlights =

The basic usage:

  * add "blend" layer
  * set source and overlay layer to the source image (should be already set by default)
  * set its type to "overlay invert"
  * play with alpha slider

It's better to blend with blured version of image, so let's try again:

  * add "blur" layer
  * set type to "gaussian blur"
  * add "blend layer"
  * set source to source image and overlay to blended layer
  * set type to "overlay invert"
  * play with alpha

One more optimization can be done if you want to preserve more highlights or more shadows from original version:

  * add one more "blend" layer
  * set source to the last layer (the one which is already after shadows and highlights processing)
  * set overlay to the source image (original one)
  * set mode to "darken" or "lighten"
  * play with alpha

*tip* you can achieve better results when using BW version of your photo instead original RGB one (which of course gives you lots of possibilities how to convert to BW first)

= dreamy image =

  * add "blur" layer
  * add "blend" layer
  * in blend layer set source to source image and overlay to blur layer
  * set type to "overlay"
  * play with alpha

if you want to preserve sharp edges, you can also:

  * add "high pass" layer
  * set source of "high pass" to original image
  * add "blend layer"
  * set source of blend to the "dreamy" version
  * set overlay of blend to "high pass" layer
  * set type to "overlay"

*tip* try that in other colorspaces than RGB too

= Orton effect =

This is simple and nice looking effect (please google for more info).

  * add "blend" layer
  * set name of the layer to "sharp" and blend mode to "screen"
  * add "blur" layer
  * set blur type to "gaussian blur" (or try all types)
  * add "blend layer"
  * set name of the second blend layer to "soft"
  * change source of "soft" layer to "sharp" layer 
  * change blend mode to "multiply"
  * play with sliders:
    * alpha slider in "sharp" layer
    * blur sliders in "blur" layer
    * alpha slider in "soft" layer

Let me explain again, because it looks compilated. You should have 4 layers:

  * 0 - source image
  * 1 - sharp
  * 2 - blur
  * 3 - soft

Layer 1 "sharp" should have blend mode set to "screen".
Layer 3 "soft" should have blend mode set to "multiply" and source to "1".

How this works?

  * layer "sharp" increases brightness of light areas (screen mode)
  * layer "blur" produces soften version of "sharp" layer 
  * layer "soft" blends "sharp" with "blur" in multiply mode - makes it darker again

*tip* you can add another "blend" layer to blend with original image (set source to "3" and overlay to "0")
