#summary How to use it

= apply luminance = 

  * open source image
  * add "curves" layer (in RGB)
  * play with curves to achieve best contrast, don't worry about colors
  * add "apply luminance" layer
  * in "apply luminance" set source layer to the source image and overlay layer to curves
  
The result is photo with same colors as original, but much better contrast.

= apply color = 

  * open source image (or just continue processing from last section)
  * add "curves" layer (in RGB)
  * play with curves to achieve best color, don't worry about contrast
  * add "apply color" layer
  * in "apply color" set source layer to the one from first step and overlay layer to curves
  
The result is photo with colors you set by curves, but preserving original contrast.

= convert image to Black and White = 

There are many ways to achieve that, there are complete books about this subject. So let's just look at two simple ways.

  * add "mixer layer"
  * change mixer colorspace to BW
  * play with sliders

Using mixer is the most common way of doing that, but after my experiences with portraits I found one more interesting solution. It's based on green channel (assuming your source is RGB) and overlays red and blue channels on it.

  * add "rgb2bw layer"
  * play with sliders
