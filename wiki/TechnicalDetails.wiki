#summary Technical Details

delaboratory is written in C++ and uses wxWidgets for GUI

wxWidgets if mature, complete and uses GTK (at least on my system), and opposing to GTK it's written in C++ not C, so it fits great, the only problem with wxWidgets is lack of support for 16-bit images, so I needed to use libtiff for accessing 16-bit tiffs, but libtiff is already requirement in your system so don't worry about it

delaboratory should follow KISS principle - keep it simple

premature optimization is root of all evil, I know how to optimize things, I wrote software texture+bump renderer for demoscene intro64 in pure assembler when I was 16, but I know how dumb optimization can destroy software project, the project should work in realtime, when you move slider or point on curve you should see result on screen, when it's too slow - optimization may be needed, when it's OK - optimization shouldn't be done

the main requirement for delaboratory is to be functional - to really process photos, if you use the application it will be alive, if the software is not really helping you with anything - it will die

I develop code on Arch Linux
