= language and toolkit =

delaboratory is written in C++ and uses wxWidgets for GUI

wxWidgets if mature, complete and uses GTK (at least on my system), and opposing to GTK it's written in C++ not C, so it fits great, the only problem with wxWidgets is lack of support for 16-bit images, so I needed to use libtiff for accessing 16-bit tiffs, but libtiff is already requirement in your system so don't worry about it

= design rules =

delaboratory should follow KISS principle - keep it simple

do not sacrifice code clarity for speed, don't waste time on optimization when it's not needed

the main requirement for delaboratory is to be functional - to really process photos, if you use the application it will be alive, if the software is not really helping you with anything - it will die

= details = 

each operation is an adjustment layer and is stored as deLayer:
  * deSourceImageLayer
  * deConversionLayer
  * deMixerLayer
  * deCurvesLayer
  * deBlendLayer

each deLayer has its dePreview, which is just an image in given colorspace

each dePreview contains number of deChannels, for BW colorspace it will be 1 channel, for RGB/LAB colorspaces there will be 3 channels and for CMYK there will be 4

each deChannel is an array of deValue, deValue is defined as float but can be redefined easily, I don't see why would anyone need double instead float but it should work

float means that each value is stored in 32 bits, it means that one RGB pixel is stored in 96bits and one CMYK pixel is stored in 128bits

conversion between colorspaces is performed only in two cases:
  * when rendering image on screen (conversion to RGB)
  * when using deConversionLayer

other layers can change the colorspaces but without conversion, for instance it's legal to mix RGB image into BW image, but it's also perfectly legal to mix CMYK into LAB (but don't expect it to look good) :)

you can't change colorSpace in curves layer because I don't see any point for that

I develop code on Arch Linux, I use wxWidgets 2.8.12 and gcc 4.6.0
